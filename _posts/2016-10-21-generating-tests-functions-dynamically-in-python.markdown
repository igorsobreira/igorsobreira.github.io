title: Generating test functions dynamically in Python
---

Some tests I write get tedious and repetitive, even with custom asserts to make it easier. For instance, take this test from a Django project I'm working on:

    import myapp.views

    def test_my_view_requires_login():
        assert_login_required(myapp.views.my_view)

I have a `@login_required` decorator and a function `assert_login_required` that checks if a view has been decorated with it. I know the test is quite small but I decided to do some metaprogramming and simplify it even further:

	import myapp.views

	ensure_login_required(myapp.views.my_view)

Here is the code for `ensure_login_required`:

	import sys

	def ensure_login_required(view):
		"""
		Generate a test function checking that 'view' is using @login_required
		"""
		def test_func():
			assert_login_required(view)

		# get global namespace from where this function is being called, if I use
		# globals() here I'll actually get the global namespace of this module
		namespace = sys._getframe(1).f_globals
		namespace['test_%s_requires_login' % view.__name__] = test_func
